# Title: **Understanding Self-Attention in Transformers**

![image](https://github.com/gjkaur/CoursesNotes/assets/36306330/f85a271d-cf1e-4ce1-867a-5e2ba8b53c0e)

1. **Role of Self-Attention**:
   - Enables the model to determine contextual relationships between words in a sentence.
   - Example: In "The monkey ate that banana because it was too hungry," self-attention helps identify that "it" refers to "monkey."

2. **Mechanism of Self-Attention**:
   - Uses embeddings of all other words in the sentence.
   - Assigns weights to words based on their relevance to the target word ("it" in the example).
   - Higher weights indicate stronger relevance.

3. **Query, Key, and Value Vectors**:
   - Word embeddings are projected into three vector spaces: query, key, and value.
   - These projections help in calculating attention weights.

4. **Calculating Attention Weights**:
   - The query and key vectors are used to calculate scores for each word.
   - The dot product of the query and key vectors determines the similarity.
   - Similar queries and keys yield higher dot products, indicating higher relevance.

5. **Scaling and Softmax**:
   - The dot product is scaled by dividing by the square root of the dimension (N) to control its size.
   - Softmax function converts the scaled scores into probabilities.

6. **Weighted Sum**:
   - Each value vector is multiplied by its corresponding softmax score.
   - The weighted value vectors are summed to produce the self-attention output for each word.

7. **Application**:
   - Self-attention is applied to every word in the sentence.
   - Allows different weights to be assigned to words, enhancing the model's understanding of context and relationships.

# Title: **Multi-Head Attention and Feed Forward Network in Transformers**

![image](https://github.com/gjkaur/CoursesNotes/assets/36306330/df1514f8-f485-4a2a-88f2-d6e358602a47)

![image](https://github.com/gjkaur/CoursesNotes/assets/36306330/ddf0cc26-cdf6-4f62-bf16-14519489de7b)



1. **Multi-Head Attention**:
   - Extends the concept of self-attention by using multiple attention mechanisms simultaneously.
   - Each attention head can focus on different aspects of the sentence, such as linking nouns to adjectives or connecting pronouns to their subjects.

2. **Implementation**:
   - BERT uses 12 attention heads, while larger models like GPT-3 use up to 96 heads.
   - Each head receives three inputs: query, key, and value.
   - These inputs are processed through linear (dense) layers before applying the multi-head attention function.

3. **Function of Attention Heads**:
   - Each attention head performs its self-attention calculations independently.
   - The multiple heads allow the model to jointly attend to information from different parts of the sentence and from different perspectives.
   - This results in richer and more nuanced connections between words.

4. **Learning Connections**:
   - The connections made by each attention head are not manually defined but are learned from the data during training.
   - This learning ability enhances the model's capacity to understand and generate complex language patterns.

5. **Feed Forward Network**:
   - After the multi-head attention mechanism, the output passes through a feed forward network.
   - This network typically consists of two linear layers with a ReLU activation function in between.
   - It helps in further processing and refining the information captured by the attention heads.

6. **Importance**:
   - Multi-head attention allows the transformer model to handle multiple tasks and representations simultaneously, improving its performance on a wide range of NLP tasks.
   - The learned connections contribute to the model's understanding and generation capabilities, making it highly effective for complex language tasks.

### Key Takeaways

**1. Size and Scale:**
   - **Parameters**: PaLM is the largest dense parameter model, boasting 540 billion parameters. It surpasses GPT-3 (175 billion), Gopher (280 billion), and Megatron-Turing NLG (530 billion) in size.
   - **Training Setup**: Utilizing Google's Pathways system, PaLM was trained on 6,144 hardware accelerators, a significant increase compared to earlier models.

**2. Efficiency:**
   - **Model Flops Utilization**: PaLM exhibits increased model flops utilization, effectively doubling the efficiency compared to previous models like GPT-3. This improvement is attributed to advancements in model and compiler technology over the years.

**3. Training Data:**
   - **Corpus**: PaLM was trained on 780 billion tokens from a multilingual corpus encompassing text from over 100 languages. Approximately 78% of the training data was in English. The dataset included multi-language social media conversations, filtered web pages, books, GitHub, Wikipedia, and news articles.

**4. Performance and Scaling:**
   - **Scaling Insights**: Google's research highlighted that certain tasks could only be performed once the model reached a specific scale. For instance, at 8 billion parameters, PaLM could handle tasks like question answering and arithmetic. At 62 billion parameters, it could manage translation and summarization. It required scaling up to 540 billion parameters to perform tasks such as general knowledge and joke explanation effectively.

### Demonstration of Capabilities

**1. Joke Explanation:**
   - **Example**: When tasked with explaining jokes, PaLM was able to understand and explain humor effectively. For instance:
     - **Joke**: "I was going to fly to visit my family on April 6th. My mom said, 'Oh great, your stepdad's poetry reading is that night.' So now I'm flying in on April 7th."
     - **PaLM's Explanation**: "The joke is that the speaker's mother is trying to get them to go to their stepdad's poetry reading, but the speaker doesn't want to go, so they're changing their flights to the day after the poetry reading."
   - **Comparison with GPT-3**: GPT-3 struggled with this joke, incorrectly interpreting it.

**2. Arithmetic and Logical Reasoning:**
   - **Example**: When solving arithmetic problems, PaLM performed better with a chain-of-thought prompting method.
     - **Standard Prompt Example**: "Roger has five tennis balls. He buys two more cans of tennis balls. Each can has three tennis balls. How many tennis balls does he have now?" The answer should be 11.
     - **Chain-of-Thought Prompt Example**: "Roger started with five balls. He bought two cans of three tennis balls each (6 balls). So, 5 + 6 = 11."
     - **Improved Answer**: By explaining the steps, PaLM could follow the reasoning and arrive at the correct answer.

### Conclusion

PaLM is currently the largest and most powerful dense parameter model, achieving state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of tasks. Its development demonstrates the importance of scaling and efficient utilization of computational resources in advancing the capabilities of language models.
